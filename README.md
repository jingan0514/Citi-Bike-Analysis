Subscribers are annual members and customers are those who buy 24-hour pass or 3-day pass users. As predicted, there are much more subscribers than customers. The analysis on the average trip duration among different user type shows customers use citibikes longer than subscribers. It is likely that customers are generally tourists in NYC. They use citibikes to travel between different attractions. Customers are usually among 20 to 40 while subscribers have a large age range. The records also show that the peak hours for customers and subscribers are different. Customers use citibikes most in the afternoon and subscribers use citibikes most in rush hours.
